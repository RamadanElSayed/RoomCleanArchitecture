User Management Android App
This project demonstrates an Android app built with Clean Architecture and the Repository pattern. It includes modern Android development tools and libraries such as Room Database, MVI pattern, Coroutines, Flow, Jetpack Compose, SharedPreferences, and Hilt for dependency injection.

Technologies and Architecture
Clean Architecture: Separate layers for data, domain, and presentation to ensure modular and maintainable code.
Repository Pattern: Manages data sources consistently, enabling clear separation between data access and business logic.
Room Database: Provides local data storage and retrieval with SQLite.
Model-View-Intent (MVI) Pattern: Structured approach for handling user interactions and state.
Coroutines & Flow: For asynchronous data processing and live updates.
Jetpack Compose: Modern toolkit for building reactive UIs.
SharedPreferences: For storing user-specific small data.
Hilt: Simplifies dependency injection for modular and testable code
